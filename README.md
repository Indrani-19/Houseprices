Kaggle Competition: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

Project Overview

Situation: Participated in an active Kaggle competition using the Ames Housing dataset to predict house sale prices.

Task: Build a regression model to accurately predict house prices based on 79 explanatory variables.

Action:
Explored and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
Visualized correlations to identify key features influencing the target variable (SalePrice).
Preprocessed data and applied advanced regression techniques to train the model.

Result: Developed a highly accurate model to predict house prices, improving performance through feature engineering and data cleaning.
